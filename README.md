## 🎯 **What This Does (In 30 Seconds)**

Transform messy PDFs into structured, searchable outlines automatically:

```
📄 Input: Complex PDF (Travel Guide, Manual, Recipe Book)
    ↓ 
🤖 AI Processing: Multi-signal heading detection + ML ensemble
    ↓
📊 Output: JSON outline with ranked sections
```

## 📝 **Approach**

Our system leverages a robust ensemble approach centered on **logistic regression** to combine multiple weak signals into a powerful heading detection engine. Each candidate heading in a PDF is evaluated using a diverse set of features: font size, font weight, text position, typography, text patterns, and structural cues. Instead of relying on a single rule or threshold, we use logistic regression to learn the optimal weights for each feature, allowing the model to adapt to different document types and layouts. This ensemble method ensures that even if one signal is weak or noisy (e.g., font size is inconsistent), the combined evidence from all signals leads to accurate heading detection. The logistic regression model outputs a confidence score for each candidate, which is then used to filter and rank headings, resulting in a highly reliable outline structure.

To ensure modularity and maintainability, we employ several classic software design patterns. The **Strategy pattern** allows us to plug in different heading detection algorithms or feature extractors without changing the core logic, making the system extensible for future improvements. The **Factory pattern** is used to dynamically construct signal extractors and detectors based on the document context, enabling flexible and scalable feature engineering. The **Observer pattern** powers our logging and monitoring system, capturing key events and decisions throughout the pipeline for debugging and explainability. We also utilize **dependency injection** to flexibly manage and swap out core components (such as signal extractors, scorers, and output writers), making the system highly configurable and testable.

For performance and scalability, the system incorporates an **LRU-based caching mechanism** to store and quickly retrieve results of expensive computations, such as repeated feature extraction or PDF parsing, significantly speeding up batch operations and iterative development. **Batch processing** is supported natively, allowing the system to process large collections of PDFs efficiently in a single run, with robust error handling and progress tracking. To maintain output quality, a **deduplication logic** is applied during heading extraction and outline construction, ensuring that redundant or overlapping headings are merged or removed, resulting in clean, non-repetitive outlines. Together, these techniques and patterns create a clean, testable, and production-ready architecture that is easy to extend and adapt for new document types or hackathon challenges.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Transparency & Debugging Outputs

In addition to the required output JSON (which matches the hackathon submission schema), our system generates rich supplementary artifacts for transparency and technical review:

- **Debug JSONs:** For every processed PDF, a detailed debug JSON is saved in the `output/` folder. This file includes all ranking scores, confidence values, and the full breakdown of signals used for each heading decision. Judges and reviewers can inspect these files to see exactly how the ensemble and ML logic arrived at each result.
- **Logs:** All pipeline events, feature scores, and decision points are logged to the `output/` folder. This provides a step-by-step trace of the processing pipeline, useful for debugging and demonstrating the explainability of our approach.

### 📝 Debug Output JSON Format
Each file in `output/` contains a detailed breakdown of the detected headings and their properties. The format is:

```json
{
  "title": "<Document Title>",
  "headings": [
    {
      "text": "<Heading Text>",
      "level": <Heading Level>,
      "page": <Page Number>,
      "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2],
      "confidence": <Confidence Score>,
      "metadata": {
        "font_size": <Font Size>,
        "is_bold": <true/false>,
        "font": "<Font Name>",
        "text_length": <Length of Heading Text>,
        "position_on_page": <Y Position>,
        ... // other context features
      }
    },
    ...
  ],
  "document_type": "<Type>",
  "processing_time": <Seconds>,
  "confidence_score": <Overall Score>,
  "metadata": { ... document-level metadata ... }
}
```

- `bbox` gives the bounding box of the heading on the page.
- `metadata` provides detailed context for each heading (font size, bold, font, etc.).

> **Note:** Only the required output JSON in the `outputs/` folder should be used for official submission. The `debug_output/` and `logs/` folders are provided for transparency and to showcase the technical depth of our solution.

## 📄 Required Output JSON Format (for Evaluation)

The official output JSONs (in `outputs/`) must follow this format:

```json
{
  "title": "<Document Title>",
  "outline": [
    {
      "level": "<Heading Level>",
      "text": "<Heading Text>",
      "page": <Page Number>
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

- `title`: The document's main title.
- `outline`: An array of heading objects, each with:
  - `level`: The heading level (e.g., H1, H2, H3)
  - `text`: The heading text
  - `page`: The page number (integer, 0-based)

> **Only this format is used for evaluation and official submission.**
> The debug_output and logs provide additional technical transparency, but are not required for evaluation.

## 📊 Output JSON Field Explanations

Both the main output JSON (e.g., `outputs/file01.json`) and the detailed debug output (e.g., `debug_output/detailed_output.json`) contain a variety of fields that provide insight into the document analysis process. Here’s what each key metric and field means:

### Top-Level Fields
- **metadata**: Contains information about the input documents, processing timestamp, and configuration.
- **extracted_sections**: List of document sections ranked by relevance to the analysis context.
- **subsection_analysis**: Refined text extracted between headings for deeper context.
- **document_summaries**: Summary information for each processed PDF.

### Section Fields (in `extracted_sections`)
- **document**: The name of the PDF document.
- **page**: The page number (0-based index) where the section appears.
- **section_title**: The heading or title of the section.
- **level**: The heading level (e.g., H1, H2) as detected by the outline builder.
- **importance_rank**: The rank of the section’s importance (1 = most important for the analysis context).
- **importance_score**: The computed score reflecting the section’s overall relevance.
- **relevance_factors**: A breakdown of the signals used to compute the importance score. Typical fields include:
  - **tfidf_similarity**: The cosine similarity between the section text and the analysis query using TF-IDF vectors. Higher means more relevant.
  - **section_length**: The length of the section text (in words or characters), used as a signal for content richness.
  - **page_position**: The normalized position of the section within the document (earlier sections may be more important).
  - **heading_level**: The detected heading level (e.g., 1 for H1, 2 for H2), which can influence importance.
  - **font_size**: The average font size of the section heading, if available (larger headings may be more important).

### Subsection Analysis Fields
- **document**: The PDF document name.
- **refined_text**: The text content between the current heading and the next, providing deeper context for the section.
- **page**: The page number.
- **level**: The heading level.
- **importance_score**: The same score as in the main section list.

### Document Summaries
- **name**: The file name of the PDF.
- **path**: The file path to the PDF.
- **num_pages**: Number of pages in the document.
- **num_sections**: Number of detected sections/headings.

## 🛠️ **The Secret Sauce: Multi-Signal Ensemble**

Unlike basic font-size detectors, our system combines **8 AI signals**:

```python
🔍 Font Analysis     → Size, weight, family changes
📐 Position Tracking → Indentation, margins, spacing  
🎨 Typography Cues   → Bold, italic, underline patterns
🔢 Pattern Matching  → Numbers, bullets, capitalization
📏 Structural Logic  → Hierarchy validation, sequence check
🧠 ML Ensemble       → Logistic regression weights all signals
⚡ Adaptive Filters  → Dynamic thresholds by document type
🔧 Quality Control   → Noise filtering, span merging
```

**Result**: Robust heading detection across diverse document layouts!

---

## 📝 **How It Works**

We extract all text spans from the PDF, score them with 8 different signals, and use logistic regression to combine them. The result is a robust, explainable outline for any PDF—no pretrained models or external datasets required, just pure algorithmic and ML ensemble logic.
